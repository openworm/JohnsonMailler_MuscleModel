## Johnson & Mailler Muscle Model

[![Continuous build using OMV](https://github.com/openworm/JohnsonMailler_MuscleModel/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openworm/JohnsonMailler_MuscleModel/actions/workflows/omv-ci.yml)

**Work in progress!!**

C. elegans muscle model from [Johnson & Mailler, Modeling Action Potentials of Body Wall Muscles in C. elegans: A Biologically Founded Computational Approach, BICOB 2015](http://searchdl.org/index.php/conference/downloadPDF/1102).

Currently there is work on a conversion of this model to [NeuroML 2](/NeuroML2), which was begun by Ramin Hasani and David Lung. 

This model is being investigated for inclusion in [c302](https://github.com/openworm/CElegansNeuroML/tree/master/CElegans/pythonScripts/c302) as part of the [OpenWorm project](http://www.openworm.org). 

See [here](https://github.com/openworm/muscle_model/issues/63) for more discussion on C. elegans muscle modelling in the project.
